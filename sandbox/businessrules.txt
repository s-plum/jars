1) Support multiple users entering data simultaneously
2) Assign each user a unique ID
3) Track rounds for each user
4) Create rounds for each user
- Each round presents user with a large urn and a small urn. Log whether small urn is on the left or the right of the screen
- Log which urn was picked
- In each round, small urn contains 10 marbles and large urn contains 100 marbles
- In each round, log probability of marble in small urn being red - 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 are all equally likely --> baseodds = 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.4
- In each round, number of marbles in big urn = (baseodds*100)+epislon, where epsilon = -3 | -2 | -1 | 1 | 2 | 3
- In each round, calculate whether marble pulled was red or not
- If epislon is positive and user chose small urn, then they made supoptimal choice.
